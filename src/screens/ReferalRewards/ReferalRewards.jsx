                and their referred friends or family members. Through this
                program, both parties can benefit from cash value rewards for

              </h5>
              <p className="text-justify responsiveFontLarge first text-black fs-6  pt-2">
                Our Referral Program is a win-win opportunity for both you and
                your friends or family members. When you refer someone to Legal
                Remit and they successfully complete a transaction, both you and
                your referral will receive cash value rewards.

                Here's how the Referral Program works:
              </h5>
              <p className="text-justify responsiveFontLarge first text-black fs-6  pt-2">
                1. Refer a friend or family member: Share your unique referral
                link or code with your friends or family members who are
                interested in using Legal Remit's cross-border payment services.
                <br />
                2. Your referral signs up and completes a transaction: Your
                referred friend or family member will need to sign up for a
                Legal Remit account using your referral link or code. Once they
                complete a successful transaction, both of you will be eligible
                for the cash value rewards.
              </p>
              <p className="text-justify responsiveFontLarge first text-black fs-6  pt-2">
                The exact cash value reward will depend on the ongoing promotion
                or offer at the time of the referral. Rest assured, Legal Remit
                regularly introduces exciting rewards to make your referrals
                even more rewarding. You can stay updated with our latest offers
                by visiting our website, mobile app or keeping an eye on our
                promotional emails and notifications.

                Rewards Program: Accumulate Points for Transactions
              </h5>
              <p className="text-justify responsiveFontLarge first text-black fs-6  pt-2">
              In addition to the cash value rewards through referrals, Legal Remit offers a Rewards Program based on a point system. Every transaction you make using Legal Remit earns you points, which can later be redeemed for various benefits and rewards.
              </p>
              <p className="text-justify responsiveFontLarge first text-black fs-6  pt-2">
                Here's how the Rewards Program point system works:
              </p>

              <p className="text-justify responsiveFontLarge first text-black fs-6  pt-2">
                1. Earn points for every dollar sent: For every dollar you send
                through Legal Remit, you will receive 1 point. The more you
                send, the more points you accumulate. For example, if you send
                $500 in a transaction, you will receive 500 points.
                <br />
                2. Get bonus points for each transaction: In addition to the
                points earned based on the transaction amount, you will also
                receive a bonus of 100 points per transaction. This means that
                for every successful transaction you make, you will receive an
                additional 100 points.
              </p>
              <p className="text-justify responsiveFontLarge first text-black fs-6  pt-2">
                Accumulating points is simple and automatic. With each
                transaction, your point balance will increase accordingly. These
                points can be redeemed for a range of exciting rewards,
                including discounts on future transactions, exclusive
                promotional offers, or even merchandise from our partners. The
                exact rewards available and the redemption process can be found
                on our website, mobile app or by contacting our customer support
                team.

                          time to time based on our ongoing promotions or
                          offers. The specific reward value will be communicated

                          in five separate transaction to consume full value

                          All rewards earned through the Referral and Rewards
                          Program will be distributed to be used in multiple
                          transactions instead of a one-time discount. The
                          specific usage requirements will be communicated to
                          you at the time of reward distribution.

                          For example, if you receive a $20 voucher as a reward,
                          you may be eligible to use it in one transaction, or
                          you may need to make multiple transactions to consume
                          the full $20 reward value.

                        <li>
                          To use the rewards value, you must meet a minimum
                          transaction amount threshold. For example, if the
                          minimum threshold is set at $200, you can redeem and
                          use the rewards value for transactions equal to or
                          exceeding $200. If you send an amount lower than $200
                          in a transaction, you will not be able to redeem and
                          use the cash balance of your rewards.
